❌ Bad Code:\n```javascript\nfunction sum(){ return a + b;}\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n*   ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function. This will lead to errors (likely `ReferenceError`) when the function tries to access them.\n*   ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, which limits its reusability.  It's unclear what values `a` and `b` should represent.\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n*   ✔ **Clear Argument Definition:** The function now explicitly accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making its purpose clear.\n*   ✔ **Correct Scope:**  `a` and `b` are now parameters of the function, making them accessible within the function's scope.\n*   ✔ **Increased Reusability:** The function can now be called with different values for `a` and `b`, providing more flexibility.\n\nFinal Note:\n\nThis is a very common mistake for beginners.  Always ensure that the variables you use within a function are either passed as arguments or defined within the function's scope.  Consider adding input validation, especially if these arguments are coming from external sources (e.g., user input) to prevent unexpected errors. For example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {\n    console.error(\"Both arguments must be numbers.\");\n    return NaN; // Returns NaN (Not a Number) to indicate an error\n  }\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n
